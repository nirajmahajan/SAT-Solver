Project has three subparts : Sudoku Solver, nQueens, Tournament Scheduler

The directory structure of the submission is as follows
Project
	nQueens :- Contains nQueens.rkt
	SAT :- Contains a general SAT solver
	Scheduler :- contains three files, (run scheduler.rkt) (unfortunately, due to a very large number of variables, 				this is unable to return an answer in reasonable time)
	Sudoku :- Contains the files for sudoku solver
	Utils :- Contains other utilities like macros, 2d-vector, and general functions used by the sat solvers

To run Sudoku Solver, Open Graphic-sudoku.rkt and run it. The prompt will ask for a sudoku problem, which, on pressing enter will get solved

For , NQueens, simply run Graphics-Nqueens
